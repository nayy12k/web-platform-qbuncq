<h1><u>Dees Closet</u></h1>
<h2>Get To Know Dee</h2>
<p> Hi my name is Dee im 28 from Brooklyn i always felt that clothes brought confidence and expressed individuality for everyone. When i put on clothes it made me feel happy and free mentally and physically, but sometimes in this world we can be blinded by price tags. On Dees Closet my goal is for you to feel beautiful and happy while also being afforable no matter your shape,size or gender. </p>
